She kept telling me about the amazing conversations she had with her tea-mate and encouraged me to sign up.,"I grew up really close with my grandparents who passed away during COVID, and I miss having those cross-generational conversations. They always had such interesting perspectives on life and I learned so much from them. I am studying engineering which is pretty male-dominated and technical, so I would love to have meaningful conversations outside my usual bubble. Plus, I am terrible at keeping in touch with people and having a scheduled weekly call would help me be more intentional about connecting with others.","English, but I also speak Gujarati with my parents when I call them",Chai! Or any black tea really,"I am a junior studying mechanical engineering at UConn. I am part of the robotics club and we compete in regional competitions.

My children live out of state and while we talk regularly, they are busy with their own lives. I think it would be enriching to connect with a younger person and learn about what life is like for them today. The world has changed so much! I am also curious about what challenges young people face now compared to what I experienced.",English,Earl Grey,"I am a retired accountant who now spends my time gardening, reading mystery novels, and spoiling my two grandchildren when they visit.

My tea-mate and I had such fascinating discussions about everything from politics to cooking to travel. We are still Facebook friends!

This seemed like a great way to learn firsthand about intergenerational relationships while also making a genuine connection. I am also interested in oral history and would love to hear stories from someone who lived through different historical moments.
